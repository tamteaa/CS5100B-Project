You may use the BM25 score for each document as input, as well as the query, of course, and any other properties of the documents you look up with the `reader` object.  After computing a new score for each candidate, re-sort the top-1000 results by your model's score.\n",
        "\n",
        "You may use anything you've learned in this course---or in another course---to build your ranking function. For example, you could implement pseudo-relevance feedback or a relevance model, which would treat the top of each ranked list (e.g., the top 100) as if it were truly relevant and retrain model parameters. You could tune different BM25, query likelihood, or sequential dependence model parameters. You could try to learn different weights or embeddings for different fields in documents. You could use implementations of transformer language models such as BERT or SentenceBERT to score the compatibility of queries and documents. To be clear, you don't have to any of these approaches; you are free to try whatever ideas you like.\n",
